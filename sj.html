		<div class="j">The oil, mining and gas industries are central to the economies of many developing countries. At the same time, these industries often give rise to human rights problems 
			so serious that they can devastate vulnerable communities. Human Rights Watch investigates how lucrative and politically important extractives projects can become entangled with abuses by 
			unaccountable security forces; undermine the livelihoods of families forced to relocate to make way for them; and fuel government corruption that undermines the very economic promise these 
			industries might otherwise represent. We work to develop solutions to the problems we expose, taking our research directly from impacted communities to the boardrooms of leading multinationals
			and the offices of government regulators.<br>
			According to The Human Rights Impact of Bauxite Mining in Guinea, "Damage to water sources that residents attribute to mining, as well as increased demand due to population migration to mining 
			sites, reduces communities access to water for drinking, washing and cooking. Women, who are primarily responsible for fetching water, are forced to walk longer distances or wait for long periods 
			to obtain water from alternative sources. The dust produced by bauxite mining and transport smothers fields and enters homes, leaving families and health workers worried that reduced air quality 
			threatens their health and environment."<br>
			By recycling we can use fewer resources and to reuse those materials many times over. This means less mining, less logging, and less demand for raw materials. With less pressure on scarce supplies, 
			there will be fewer resource-driven conflicts.</div>
