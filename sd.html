		44% of trash in a lanfill is food materials. Methane is created when microorganisms break down (or biodegrade) the 
		organic matter that is contained in landfills. Methane gas often smells bad and can cause some respiratory problems for humans. In addition 12% is plastic
		and that can take hundreds of years to break down.</div>
		
		<div class="item o">
		Landfill liners have several layers: first, a layer of soil as a foundation for the waste; then, a geotextile layer that lets water 
		through but filters out any little pieces of trash; then, a leachate collection system, which consists of gravel that allows water to filter down to pipes 
		where it is collected; under the leachate collection system, liners are required to have a plastic layer in order to prevent leachate from reaching the 
		groundwater; and finally, liners have an impermeable clay layer to stop any water that may make it through the plastic.</div>

		<div class="item r">All this trash has to go somewhere. It goes to landfills all over the U.S. where leaching occurs. Leaching is the process of water (usually in the form of precipitation, such as rain) filtering through a landfill, which then carries whatever contaminants
		that are in the landfill out with the ground or surface water. After water has filtered through a landfill, it is called leachate. Leachate commonly contains 
		high concentrations of chemicals, heavy metals and microbial life. Chemicals come from many different industrial wastes that are dumped at landfills or 
		agricultural waste that contains large amounts of pesticides.</div>
