		<a class="other">Other things you can do:</a><br>
			-Opt for recycled products, regardless of whether it's the product itself or their packaging. When you buy recycled products, you are helping all those manufacturers who recycle various materials. <br>
			-Try to use common services more often, like renting equipment and tools instead of buying them.<br>
			-Buy items that come in recyclable packaging and buy them in bulk. Avoid disposable and non-biodegradable items. Carry a reusable canvas bag when you go shopping.<br>
			-Look out for unnecessary packaging when you buy products. If you think that there is unnecessary packaging, contact the manufacturer and tell them about it. This suggestion may go a long way in how 
				economically and efficiently the packaging is done in the future.<br>
			-Try to make recycling a part of your daily life. Every time you throw something, be sure to check if it can be recycled or reused.<br>
